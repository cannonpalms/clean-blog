bio: "Lovemme Corazón es una xingona. Their part-time life as a mercreature has been realized on the shores in Santa Cruz, California, where they are currently residing to attend the University of California, Santa Cruz and majoring in Psychology. They focus their energy into discussions around trauma, abuse, vulnerability, love, and communal care through the intersections of race, class, gender, and disability. Still healing from the scars of activist burnout, Lovemme has turned to their close friends and community in practicing what they preach. Lovemme’s work centers around personal successes and failures in navigating the world as a healer."
